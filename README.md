# Tennis Time 🎾

## What is it?
A web application that allows the client (my amazing mother-in-law 🙋🏼‍♀️) to schedule future tennis court reservations. It seems that the tennis courts are very popular and reservations can be tricky to get. The [front end](https://markalperin.com/tennis-time) collects reservation input from the user, displays upcoming and booked reservations, and allows for their cancelation. The back end provides standard CRUD functionality and automates making/canceling reservations via Puppeteer bot scripts, as well as as text-based user feedback via the Twilio Library.

## How is it built?
The app was built using AWS, Node.js, MongoDB, Express, React, Material UI, and Puppeteer.

### Have a look!
You can see it [here](https://markalperin.com/tennis-time), but some functionality is reserved just for the client.
