# Tennis_Time

This is a shopping bot that I am making for my Mother-In-Law. so that she can automate her tennis court reservation process. She will be able to input the desired reservation times to the front end, created in React. That information will be sent to an AWS EC2 back-end server and stored via PostgreSQL. At 9am when the tennis court reservations become available. The back end will use Puppeteer to operate a virtual chromium browser and secure the reservation.
